# Lightweight React Template for KAVIA

This project provides a minimal React template with a clean, modern UI and minimal dependencies.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: No heavy UI frameworks - uses only vanilla CSS and React
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with KAVIA brand styling
- **Fast**: Minimal dependencies for quick loading times
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and modify

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Customization

### Colors

The main brand colors are defined as CSS variables in `src/App.css`:

```css
:root {
  --kavia-orange: #E87A41;
  --kavia-dark: #1A1A1A;
  --text-color: #ffffff;
  --text-secondary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
  --border-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
}
```

## AI Chat Functionality & OpenAI API KEY SECURITY

- **Never expose your OpenAI API key in client-side/front-end code.**
- The provided Chat UI in this app stubs/fakes AI responses. For real AI replies, you must proxy API requests via a secure server.

### Production setup

1. **Create a backend endpoint** (e.g., `/api/openai/chat`) that:
    - Accepts user chat messages.
    - Forwards them to OpenAI's GPT API.
    - Injects the API key using the server's environment variable (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY`).
    - Returns the AI's response to the frontend.

2. **Refer to** [OpenAI API docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat) for the JSON API format.

3. **Update the Chat.js file** to make requests to your secure backend endpoint (search for "backend proxy" in code comments).

This approach keeps your API key safe and out of client builds.

### Components

This template uses pure HTML/CSS components instead of a UI framework. You can find component styles in `src/App.css`. 

Common components include:
- Buttons (`.btn`, `.btn-large`)
- Container (`.container`)
- Navigation (`.navbar`)
- Typography (`.title`, `.subtitle`, `.description`)
